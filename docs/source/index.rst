Welcome to Personal data exposure scanner
=========================================

**Personal data exposure scanner** is a tool that helps people find out where their personal information is exposed online and provides step-by-step guidelines for removal requests.

Detailed Concept
================

Core Purpose
------------
The scanner would help individuals discover and remediate their personal information exposures across the web, reducing their vulnerability to identity theft, social engineering attacks, and other privacy violations.

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Comprehensive Scanning Capabilities
 - Search across public databases, data brokers, breach repositories, and the open web
 - Identify exposed personally identifiable information (PII) like addresses, phone numbers, emails, and social media profiles
 - Detect exposed financial information hints (account types, institutions used)
 - Find family connection data that could be used in targeted attacks
 - Monitor dark web marketplaces for credentials associated with the user

2. Risk Assessment Dashboard
 - Overall exposure score compared to population averages
 - Categorized risk levels for different types of information
 - Timeline tracking showing exposure trends over time
 - Prioritized remediation suggestions based on risk severity

3. Guided Removal Process
 - Step-by-step instructions customized for each data source
 - Template request letters meeting legal requirements for different jurisdictions
 - Direct links to opt-out pages where available
 - Tracking system for removal requests and their status
 - Follow-up verification to confirm successful removals

4. Educational Resources
 - Contextual explanations of how specific exposures could be exploited
 - Preventative guidance to avoid future exposures
 - Best practices for different platforms and services

Implementation Approaches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**SaaS Platform**
* Web-based dashboard with user accounts and ongoing monitoring
* Mobile companion app for on-the-go privacy management
* API integration options for corporate implementations

Browser Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Real-time scanning as users browse
* Privacy suggestions while interacting with websites
* Form-filling assistance for removal requests

Business Model Options
======================

1. **B2C Direct Subscription**
* Tiered pricing based on monitoring frequency and removal assistance level
* Free basic scan with premium features for remediation

2. **B2B Employee Benefit**
* Volume licensing for companies to offer to employees
* Integration with corporate security awareness programs
* Custom reporting for security teams on organizational exposure

3. **B2B2C Financial Institution Partnership**
* Banks and insurance companies offer as value-added service
* Integrated with identity theft protection services

Technical Considerations
------------------------
- **Data Privacy:** The scanner itself must use highly secure practices to avoid creating additional privacy risks
- **Identity Verification:** Need strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access to scan results
- **Legal Compliance:** Different removal requirements across jurisdictions (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Scanning Techniques:** Balance between deep discovery and avoiding blacklisting by data sources
- **Ethical Boundaries:** Clear policies on what constitutes legitimate scanning vs. potential misuse

Development Phases
------------------
**MVP Phase:** Basic scanner covering major data brokers and breach repositories
**Expansion Phase:** Additional data sources, automated removal assistance
**Advanced Phase:** AI-powered risk assessment, predictive exposure detection

Impact Potential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Reduces phishing and social engineering success rates
- Decreases identity theft incidents
- Empowers individuals with practical privacy tools
- Helps companies reduce third-party risks through employees' personal exposures
- Creates measurable privacy improvements with before/after metrics
